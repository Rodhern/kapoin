KAPOIN, http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154223-wip122-kapoin-%E2%80%93-a-career-game-mission-idea/ .

Kapoin is in pre-alpha. I am still figuring out how to write a KSP add-on, that is more than just a snippet, and figuring out how to tag and upload releases to Github and/or Spacedock.

At present the Kapoin add-on is 'empty', in the sense that it does nothing. The test at this point is to install it, and check the logs, that the add-on is loaded, and that it does not throw exceptions left and right.

If you volunteer to install Kapoin, please make sure to backup your saved games regularly; the add-on source code is very much experimental. If you want to help out even more, please let me know. To mention just one non-coding issue that I could use a hand with, I can tell you that just to draw a 24 by 18 pixel png icon is a stretch for my Paint abilities.

For those of you that are curious about these things, the Kapoin source code is (predominantly) F-sharp code. If you want to give KSP F-sharp add-on coding a go, one possibly place to start is to take a look at this snippet, http://fssnip.net/rD .
