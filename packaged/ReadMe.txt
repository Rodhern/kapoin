KAPOIN, http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154223-wip130-kapoin-%E2%80%93-a-career-game-mission-idea/ .

Kapoin is in pre-alpha. I am still figuring out how to write a KSP add-on, that is more than just a snippet, and figuring out how to tag and upload releases to Github and/or Spacedock.

At present the Kapoin add-on is 'mostly empty', in the sense that it does almost nothing. The test at this point is to install it, and check the logs, that the add-on is loaded, and that it does not throw exceptions left and right.

If you volunteer to install Kapoin, please make sure to backup your saved games regularly; the add-on source code is very much experimental. If you want to help out even more, please let me know.

For those of you that are curious about these things, the Kapoin source code is (predominantly) F-sharp code. If you want to give KSP F-sharp add-on coding a go, one possibly place to start is to take a look at this snippet, http://fssnip.net/rD .
