## PACKAGES

At this point there are not yet any compile-time packages in use.

The compile-time files for the F-sharp core library are added to location "../output/dllrefs/".

In general, the KSP add-ons that Kapoin interfaces with are not bundled with Kapoin, neither in binary distributions nor in source code repositories.

The easiest way to get an overview of the relevant KSP add-ons is to look at the license files included in "../packaged/licenses/"
